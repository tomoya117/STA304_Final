# Application of the Modigliani-Miller Theorem to the Cash Flows of the US Government 

This repo aims to investigate the application of the Modigliani-Miller Theorem to the history of the US economy and how much the US economy follows this theory. Modigliani-Miller theorem is a financial economics theory that is usually applied to individual companies to calculate its market value independent of its capital structure. However, in this repo, I apply the Modigliani-Miller theorem to the cash flows of the US government to examine the accuracy of calculation following the Modigliani-Miller theorem when applied to something other than individual companies.

It is organised as follows:
